# p6502
A WIP command line MOS 6502 emulator done in C by yours truly
Provided a very simple test and makefile to mess around with
I got a lot of information about the 6502 from the ultimate commodore 64 ref; I didn't know much of anything about microprocessors prior to this little project, and it taught me quite a bit. So check it out if you like.
